 ## Caching
 # Why Caching?
 Caching plays a crucial role in improving the performance and efficiency of software applications and systems. It helps reduce the response time, minimizes the load on databases and resources, and ultimately enhances the user experience. By storing frequently used data in a cache, applications can quickly retrieve the data, reducing the need to perform expensive or time-consuming operations repeatedly.
